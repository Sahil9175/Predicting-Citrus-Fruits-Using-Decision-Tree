# Predicting-Citrus-Fruits-Using-Decision-Tree

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Decision Tree Classifier to predict different types of citrus fruits based on their features.

# Project Overview

Objective: Classify citrus fruits (e.g., orange, lemon, grapefruit, mandarin) using machine learning.

Algorithm Used: Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn.

Dataset: A dataset of citrus fruit features such as mass, width, height, and color score.

# Installation & Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

python 
jupyter
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn

Install dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

(You can generate a requirements.txt with the libraries listed above if not provided.)

Files in Repository

Predicting Citrus fruit using Decision Tree.ipynb → Main Jupyter notebook with code and explanations.

README.md → Project documentation.

(Optional) Dataset file (if not included, instructions below explain how to download or generate it).

# How to Run

Clone the repository or download the notebook.

Open the notebook in Jupyter:

jupyter notebook "Predicting Citrus fruit using Decision Tree.ipynb"

Run the cells step by step.

The notebook will:

Load and explore the citrus dataset.

Train a decision tree classifier.

Visualize the tree structure.

Evaluate accuracy and performance.

# Results

Decision Tree successfully classifies citrus fruits based on their physical and color features.

Performance metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix) are displayed in the notebook.

# Visualizations

Feature distributions

Decision boundaries (if applied)

Decision Tree plot

Future Improvements

Tune hyperparameters (e.g., max_depth, min_samples_split).

Compare with other models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression).

Deploy as a simple API or web app.
